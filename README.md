# stochastic-rainfall-ondo
A stochastic modeling approach to analyze rainfall variability and climate patterns in Ondo State, Nigeria, using probabilistic methods and Monte Carlo simulations.
 
The rainfall dataset used in this study was sourced from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), the official government body responsible for collecting weather and climate data in Nigeria. NiMet provides historical and real-time meteorological data crucial for climate research, weather forecasting, and agricultural planning. The dataset spans 1991 to 2020, offering valuable insights into long-term rainfall variability in the region.
